# Install the Dynamic Window manager and configure it

The installation for `dmenu` and `st` are also here because I would only use them in combination with `dwm` right now.

I would also recommend installing and setting up the LightDM display manager because with others like the Gnome Display Manager I had some problems.
See [this directory](/lightdm).
